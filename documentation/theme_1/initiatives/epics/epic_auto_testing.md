# Epic 2: Automated Testing

**Description:** Implement an automated testing framework to improve testing efficiency and reduce manual testing efforts.

**Goals:**
- Improve testing efficiency and accuracy
- Reduce manual testing efforts and costs
- Increase test coverage and frequency

**User Stories:**
- As a tester, I want to create automated test cases for frequently used functionality so that I can reduce the time and effort required for manual testing.
- As a developer, I want to integrate the automated testing framework with the build and deployment pipeline so that I can ensure the quality of code changes before release.
- As a product owner, I want to ensure that the automated tests cover all critical functionality and scenarios so that I can have confidence in the software's reliability and performance.

**Dependencies:**
- Availability of skilled test automation engineers and testers
- Adequate resources and budget for implementing and maintaining the testing framework
- Availability of suitable testing tools and frameworks

**Risks:**
- Flaky or unreliable automated test cases - Mitigation strategy: Implement continuous monitoring and maintenance of automated tests to ensure their reliability and accuracy

**Estimated Effort:**
- 3-6 months

**Business Value:**
- Improved testing efficiency and accuracy
- Reduced manual testing efforts and costs
- Increased test coverage and frequency
- Improved software quality and reliability

**Priority:**
- High
