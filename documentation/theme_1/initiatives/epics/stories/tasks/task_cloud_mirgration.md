Task Title: Set up cloud infrastructure for web application

User Story: As a web application user, I want the application to be migrated to the cloud so that it can be more easily scaled and managed.

Description: In order to migrate the web application to the cloud, we need to set up a cloud infrastructure that will support the application. This includes creating and configuring virtual machines, setting up load balancers, and configuring network security. Acceptance criteria include:

- Virtual machines are set up and configured according to application requirements
- Load balancers are set up and configured to distribute traffic to the virtual machines
- Network security is configured to protect against unauthorized access
- The web application is deployed to the virtual machines and is accessible via the load balancers

Effort Estimate: 40 hours

Assigned To: John Doe

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes: This task is dependent on the completion of the infrastructure design phase, which is currently underway.
