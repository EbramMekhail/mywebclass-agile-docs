Task Title: Set up automated UI testing for login page

User Story: As a website user, I want to be able to log in to the website with valid credentials so that I can access my account.

Description: Create automated UI tests for the login page using Selenium WebDriver. The tests should ensure that a user can successfully log in with valid credentials, receive an error message when attempting to log in with invalid credentials, and be redirected to the correct page after logging in. The tests should be designed to run on multiple browsers and operating systems. 

Effort Estimate: 8 hours

Assigned To: John Doe

Priority: Medium

Status: Not Started

Notes: The tests will need to be updated if any changes are made to the login page or user authentication system.
