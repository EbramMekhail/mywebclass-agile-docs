## User Story

As a software developer, I want to automate the testing process for our web application, so that we can catch bugs and errors earlier in the development cycle.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Automated tests are written using a modern testing framework such as Jest or Cypress
- Tests are run automatically after each code change and during continuous integration
- The automated testing process includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Test results are reported in a readable and actionable format, such as through a dashboard or notification system
- Test failures trigger alerts to the development team, including details about the failure and relevant source code
- The automated testing process is integrated into our development workflow and can be easily extended and maintained by the development team
